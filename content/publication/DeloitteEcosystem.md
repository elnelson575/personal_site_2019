abstract: "The United States (US) defense, intelligence, and homeland security communities face an increasingly complex operating environment. National security threats have transformed and diversified since the 2000s, requiring missions to be fulfilled globally a frequent shifting set of threats from state and non-state actors. Resources have not expanded along these larger mission sets. Instead, federal budgets face intensified scrutiny. This challenge forces national security agencies to prioritize limited resources and seek innovative ways to achieve mission success. An advanced understanding of stakeholders' needs and situational awareness of the cross-sector ecosystem in which the agency operates can help agency personnel succeed in this environment."
abstract_short: By examining the new and evolving ways value is created within a market ecosystem, decision-makers can achieve a more accurate perception of their own entity's current value. Pairing this perception with an understanding of the diversity of actors and activities in the ecosystem empowers the decision-maker to respond to emerging opportunities and risks.
